I learnt a lot about computers when I completed by Diploma in Computer Applications. By the 9th standard, I had learned the fundamentals of computers. Naturally, I decided to do my BCA after the 12th standard. During the course, I gained a sound understanding about computer fundamentals, Data Structure Algorithm , and programming languages like C, C++, Visual Basic, and Java.
I realised that I needed more hands-on experience if I wanted to build apps and products that help overcome everyday hurdles. That's how I decided to join Masai School, where I am currently studying how to build complex apps. I am also getting to learn how to work with teams of developers towards a shared outcome.
